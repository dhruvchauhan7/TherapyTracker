##  Running the Project Locally

### Backend – .NET API
```bash
cd TheraTrackMini.Api
dotnet restore
dotnet run

Default port → http://localhost:5000
Swagger UI → http://localhost:5000/swagger

###  Backend – .NET API
cd theratrack-mini-ui
npm install
ng serve -o

App will open on → http://localhost:4200

### Login Credentials

You can create users via Swagger (/api/clinicians or /api/auth/register):

Role	Example	Notes
Admin	admin@example.com / Passw0rd!	Full access
Clinician	clin1@example.com / Passw0rd!	Own sessions only

### Payroll Workflow

1. Clinicians mark sessions completed → system sets EndTime and Status = COMPLETED.
2. Admin reviews completed sessions in the Payroll page.
3. Admin can lock/unlock each session for payroll (via PUT /api/sessions/{id}/payroll-lock).
4. Use date range + clinician filters to narrow results.
5. Click Export CSV to download payroll data for accounting.

### Dashboard Highlights

1. Admin Dashboard: organization overview (client count, total sessions, completed in last 30 days, upcoming in 7 days).
2. Clinician Dashboard: personal workload summary with upcoming sessions and recent activity.

### Key Engineering Concepts Demonstrated

1. RESTful API design (DTOs, Entity Framework mappings)
2. Role-based access control (JWT claims & authorization policies)
3. Angular standalone components and routing
4. Reactive UI updates and modular component structure
5. End-to-end CRUD and data binding
6. Secure cross-origin communication between Angular and .NET

### Tools Used

Visual Studio 2022 – backend development
VS Code – Angular frontend
Postman / Swagger UI – API testing
Git & GitHub – source control
